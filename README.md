## **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models to predict the presence of Parkinson’s Disease using various classification algorithms:
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**

Additionally, the repository includes detailed visualizations to:
- Analyze the structure and relationships within the dataset.
- Evaluate model performance.
- Understand the importance of vocal and other medical features in classification.

## **Dataset Description**

### **Data Summary**
- **File**: `dataset.csv`
- **Number of Samples**: 1,195
- **Number of Features**: 24 (including the target variable `status`)
- **Target Variable**: `status` (binary classification)

### **Target Variable**
- `0`: No Parkinson’s Disease detected.
- `1`: Parkinson’s Disease detected.

The dataset consists of vocal and medical measurements, including metrics like frequency variation and amplitude variation, which are key indicators of Parkinson’s Disease.

---

## **Features**

Key features in the dataset include:
- **MDVP:Fo(Hz)**: Average vocal fundamental frequency.
- **MDVP:Fhi(Hz)**: Maximum vocal fundamental frequency.
- **MDVP:Flo(Hz)**: Minimum vocal fundamental frequency.
- **Jitter(%)**: Measure of frequency variation in speech.
- **Shimmer**: Measure of amplitude variation in speech.

The features underwent preprocessing to handle missing values, scale numerical attributes, and prepare the data for machine learning models.

## **Methodology**

### **Steps**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values via mean imputation.
   - Standardizing numerical features using `StandardScaler`.
2. **Model Training**:
   - Decision Tree Classifier with depth limitation.
   - Random Forest Classifier with feature and depth restrictions.
   - Gradient Boosting Classifier with regularization.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Confusion matrices to visualize performance.
   - Learning curves to analyze training behavior.
4. **Visualizations**:
   - Feature importance analysis.
   - Validation accuracy comparison.

### **Key Techniques**
- **Anti-Overfitting Measures**: Regularization, feature selection, and cross-validation.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Leveraged Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for better generalization.

## **Results**

### **Model Performance**
| Metric              | Decision Tree | Random Forest | Gradient Boosting |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Training Accuracy** | 97.99%        | 98.74%        | 97.92%            |
| **Testing Accuracy**  | 94.98%        | 97.49%        | 96.24%            |
| **Validation Accuracy**| 94.11%        | 97.18%        | 96.02%            |

### **Key Insights**
- Random Forest achieved the highest testing and validation accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization.
- Gradient Boosting closely followed with competitive performance and error reduction.
- Decision Tree was accurate but prone to overfitting without depth limitations.
